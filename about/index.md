The Boulder Code&&Coffee started with a group of Rubyists that met at [The
Cup](http://thecupboulder.com) once a week. It soon outgrew it's original
meeting place, met at [dojo4](http://dojo4.com) for a few years and hung out at
[GitHub Boulder](http://github.com) for a while.

The group is now back at its root as it is meeting every Wednesday mornings
between 9 and noon at The Cup.
