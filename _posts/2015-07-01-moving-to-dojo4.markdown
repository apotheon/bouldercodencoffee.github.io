I have many fond memories of working and hanging out at Dojo4. These
memories include posting "Over Heard" tweets graciously provided by
Garett, shipping code and horseradish bacon cream cheese.

You see, the Code&&Coffee group use to meet at Dojo4 for their weekly
meeting. Corey would bring in bagels along with an amazing horseradish
bacon spread. Coffee would be brewed and served and coders would hang
out in the different areas of the office. These were good times.

These good times are about to come back! Emily reached out to me and
extended an invitation to return to the dojo! As a result, we will
return to Dojo4 starting on July 8th. While I can't promise horseradish
bacon spread (that is entirely up to Emily), I can promise good company
and good coffee!

See you then!
